> **Note:** This repository is a work in progress.   The projection component still needs to be extracted from a larger medical application into a standalone project containing only the projection-related tools. Refactoring and documentation are in progress and will be completed by the end of **October 2025**.

# Shadow-Free Projection with Blur Mitigation on Dynamic, Deformable Surfaces
#### Paper | Video | Slides | Supplementary (Links will follow)

C++/OpenGL implementation of our real-time projection mapping system for dynamic, uneven, and partially occluded surfaces.
It uses Orbbec Femto Bolt sensors and integrates [BlendPCR](https://github.com/muehlenb/DeformableProjection) for precise geometric correction. The system also includes our novel GPU-based blur mitigation strategies that improve readability and reduce visual artifacts.
